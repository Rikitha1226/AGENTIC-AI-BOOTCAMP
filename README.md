# 🧭 Agentic AI Bootcamp 2025

“From Prompts → Planning → Autonomy”

**Duration:** 4 Days · 3 Hours Per Day  
**Level:** Beginner → Intermediate  
**Audience:** 2nd Year CSE (AIML) Students  
**Goal:** Learn to build autonomous LLM agents that reason, plan, and act using real-world tools and APIs.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this bootcamp, students will be able to:
- Understand how LLMs evolve into autonomous agents that can reason, remember and take actions.
- Build single and multi-agent systems using CrewAI and LangChain.
- Use memory, tools, and APIs for real-world task automation.
- Apply responsible AI principles (privacy, transparency, bias mitigation).
- Deploy a working Agentic AI project on Streamlit / Hugging Face Spaces.
